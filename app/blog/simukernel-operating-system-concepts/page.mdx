## CPU Scheduling

### What is CPU Scheduling?

CPU scheduling is the process of determining which process in the ready queue will be allocated the CPU for execution. The goal is to maximize CPU utilization, throughput, and minimize waiting time and response time.

### Process States

A process transitions through several states:
- **New**: Process is being created
- **Ready**: Process is waiting to be assigned to CPU
- **Running**: Instructions are being executed
- **Waiting**: Process is waiting for I/O or event
- **Terminated**: Process has finished execution

### Scheduling Algorithms

#### 1. Round Robin (RR)

**How it works:**
- Each process gets a fixed time slice (quantum)
- After quantum expires, process moves to end of ready queue
- Next process in queue gets CPU
- Preemptive algorithm

**Advantages:**
- Fair allocation of CPU time
- No starvation
- Good for time-sharing systems
- Predictable response time

**Disadvantages:**
- Context switching overhead
- Average waiting time can be high
- Performance depends on time quantum selection

**Time Quantum Selection:**
- Too small: High context switching overhead
- Too large: Becomes FCFS, poor response time
- Typical: 10-100 milliseconds

**Example:**
```
Processes: P1(burst=10), P2(burst=5), P3(burst=8)
Quantum = 4

Execution Order:
P1[0-4] → P2[4-8] → P3[8-12] → P1[12-16] → P2[16-17] → P3[17-21] → P1[21-22]
```

#### 2. Priority Scheduling

**How it works:**
- Each process has a priority number
- CPU allocated to highest priority process
- Can be preemptive or non-preemptive
- Lower number = higher priority (convention)

**Preemptive Priority:**
- Running process can be interrupted
- New higher priority process gets CPU immediately

**Non-Preemptive Priority:**
- Process runs to completion
- Priority checked only when CPU becomes free

**Advantages:**
- Important processes execute first
- Good for real-time systems
- Flexible based on process needs

**Disadvantages:**
- **Starvation**: Low priority processes may never execute
- Priority inversion in complex systems

**Starvation Prevention:**
- Aging: Gradually increase priority of waiting processes
- After threshold time, boost priority

**Example:**
```
Processes: P1(priority=3), P2(priority=1), P3(priority=4), P4(priority=2)

Non-Preemptive Order: P2 → P4 → P1 → P3
(Execution order by priority)
```

#### 3. Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ)

**How it works:**
- Multiple queues with different priorities
- Each queue has its own scheduling algorithm (usually RR)
- Different time quantums for each level
- Processes can move between queues

**Queue Structure:**
```
Queue 0 (Highest Priority) - Quantum: 2ms
Queue 1 (Medium Priority)  - Quantum: 4ms  
Queue 2 (Lowest Priority)  - Quantum: 8ms
```

**Process Movement Rules:**
1. New processes enter highest priority queue
2. If process uses entire quantum: Move down one level
3. If process blocks (I/O): Stay in same level or move up
4. If process waits too long (aging): Move up one level

**Advantages:**
- Favors short jobs (I/O-bound)
- Prevents starvation through aging
- Adapts to process behavior
- No need to know burst time in advance

**Disadvantages:**
- Complex to implement
- Requires parameter tuning
- Can have high overhead

**Real-World Use:**
- Linux CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler)
- Windows Thread Scheduler
- macOS Grand Central Dispatch

## Memory Management

### Virtual Memory

**Concept:**
- Separation of logical and physical memory
- Processes use virtual addresses
- MMU (Memory Management Unit) translates to physical addresses
- Allows running programs larger than physical RAM

**Benefits:**
- Process isolation (security)
- Efficient memory use
- Simplified programming model
- Support for shared libraries

### Paging

**How it works:**
- Divide memory into fixed-size blocks
- **Pages**: Logical memory blocks (process view)
- **Frames**: Physical memory blocks (hardware view)
- Page table maps pages to frames

**Page Table:**
```
Virtual Page → Physical Frame
    0       →      2
    1       →      5
    2       →      1
    3       →      7
```

**Address Translation:**
```
Virtual Address = Page Number + Offset
Physical Address = Frame Number + Offset

Example:
Virtual: Page 2, Offset 100
Physical: Frame 1, Offset 100
```

### Page Replacement Algorithms

When memory is full and new page needed, must replace existing page.

#### 1. FIFO (First-In-First-Out)

**Algorithm:**
- Maintain queue of pages in memory
- Replace oldest page (first loaded)

**Implementation:**
```
Queue: [P1, P2, P3, P4]
New page P5 arrives → Replace P1
Queue: [P2, P3, P4, P5]
```

**Advantages:**
- Simple to implement
- Low overhead
- Fair (all pages age equally)

**Disadvantages:**
- Belady's Anomaly: More frames can cause more faults
- Doesn't consider page usage patterns
- May replace frequently used pages

**Belady's Anomaly Example:**
```
Reference: 1,2,3,4,1,2,5,1,2,3,4,5

3 Frames: 9 page faults
4 Frames: 10 page faults (worse!)
```

#### 2. LRU (Least Recently Used)

**Algorithm:**
- Replace page not used for longest time
- Assumes: Recently used pages will be used again soon

**Implementation:**
- Timestamp each page access
- On replacement, choose minimum timestamp
- Or use stack/counter

**Advantages:**
- Better performance than FIFO
- No Belady's anomaly
- Approximates optimal

**Disadvantages:**
- High overhead (tracking access times)
- Requires hardware support
- Complex implementation

**Hardware Support:**
- Timestamp register
- Stack of page numbers
- Counter for each page table entry

**Example:**
```
Time: 0  1  2  3  4  5
Ref:  1  2  3  1  4  2

Access times when referencing page 5:
P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 2, P4: 4
Replace P3 (oldest access)
```

#### 3. Optimal Page Replacement

**Algorithm:**
- Replace page that won't be used for longest time in future
- Theoretical optimal (minimum possible faults)

**Implementation:**
- Look ahead in reference string
- For each frame, find next use time
- Replace frame with farthest next use
- If page never used again, replace it immediately

**Advantages:**
- Minimum page faults (provably optimal)
- Good benchmark for other algorithms

**Disadvantages:**
- Impossible to implement (requires future knowledge)
- Only useful for analysis and comparison

**Example:**
```
Reference: 1,2,3,4,1,2,5,1,2,3,4,5
Frames: 3

At step 6 (need to load page 5):
P1: next used at step 7 (distance: 1)
P2: next used at step 8 (distance: 2)  
P3: next used at step 10 (distance: 4)
P4: not used again (distance: ∞)

Replace P4 (optimal choice)
```

### Page Fault Handling

**Page Fault Process:**
1. CPU tries to access page not in memory
2. MMU generates page fault interrupt
3. OS locates page on disk
4. Selects victim frame (if memory full)
5. Writes victim page to disk (if modified)
6. Loads requested page into frame
7. Updates page table
8. Restarts instruction

**Page Fault Cost:**
- Trap to OS: ~1-10 microseconds
- Disk access: ~1-10 milliseconds
- Total: ~1000x slower than memory access

## Process Management

### Process Control Block (PCB)

Contains process information:
- Process ID (PID)
- Process state
- Program counter
- CPU registers
- Memory management info
- I/O status
- Accounting information

### Context Switch

**What happens:**
1. Save state of current process to PCB
2. Select next process to run
3. Restore state from new process PCB
4. Switch to user mode

**Cost:**
- Direct: Saving/restoring registers
- Indirect: Cache/TLB flush, pipeline stall
- Typical: 1-10 microseconds

### Process Creation

**Unix/Linux (fork/exec):**
```
parent process
    ↓
fork() → creates child with copy of parent memory
    ↓
exec() → replaces child memory with new program
    ↓
child executes new program
```

## Performance Metrics

### CPU Scheduling Metrics

**1. Turnaround Time**
```
Turnaround Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time
```
Total time from submission to completion.

**2. Waiting Time**
```
Waiting Time = Turnaround Time - Burst Time
```
Time spent in ready queue.

**3. Response Time**
```
Response Time = First Run Time - Arrival Time
```
Time from submission to first execution.

**4. CPU Utilization**
```
CPU Utilization = (Total CPU Busy Time / Total Time) × 100%
```
Percentage of time CPU is doing useful work.

**5. Throughput**
```
Throughput = Number of Processes / Total Time
```
Processes completed per time unit.

### Memory Management Metrics

**1. Page Fault Rate**
```
Page Fault Rate = (Number of Page Faults / Total References) × 100%
```

**2. Effective Access Time (EAT)**
```
EAT = (1 - p) × memory_access_time + p × page_fault_time

where p = page fault rate
```

**Example:**
- Memory access: 100 ns
- Page fault time: 10 ms = 10,000,000 ns
- Page fault rate: 0.1% = 0.001

```
EAT = 0.999 × 100 + 0.001 × 10,000,000
    = 99.9 + 10,000
    = 10,099.9 ns
```

**3. Memory Utilization**
```
Memory Utilization = (Used Memory / Total Memory) × 100%
```
